## 🌟 Executive Overview

Industries store thousands of SOPs, engineering manuals, maintenance reports, inspection logs, and scanned PDFs. Employees waste critical hours manually locating operational procedures during emergencies or routine maintenance.

**INDUSMIND AI** empowers plant engineers, operators, auditors, and safety officers to upload any industrial document (PDF, DOCX, Excel, Images, Scanned PDFs) and instantly ask natural language questions with **100% Anti-Hallucination RAG Grounding**.

### Every AI Answer Includes:
- **Confidence Score (%)** (e.g. 98% Match)
- **Source Document Name**
- **Exact Page Number**
- **Citation Excerpts & Direct Quotes**
- **Related Industrial Documents**

## 🏆 Hackathon Quick Evaluation Guide

For instant evaluation during judge review:
1. Open the web app and click **Sign In**.
2. Click any of the **1-Click Evaluation Login Buttons** (e.g., *Maintenance Engineer*, *Admin*, *Safety Officer*) to instantly experience role-based access.
3. Navigate to **AI Knowledge Copilot** and ask:
   - *"What is the emergency shutdown procedure for Gas Turbine GT-800?"*
   - Observe >=95% Confidence score, Source Document title, Page 4 reference, and citation quote.
4. Test **Anti-Hallucination**: Ask an unrelated sports/general question (e.g., *"Who won the 1970 World Cup?"*) and verify the response: `"I could not find this information in uploaded documents."`
5. Test **PDF Report Generator** under `/reports` to download synthesized PDF reports.
